clang-format-infer tries to find a clang-format file that matches the style of your
existing codebase as closely as possible.

Usage:

First, put the source files you want to optimize for in a directory.

Second, alter the "constants" file to fit your required options.

Finally:

./clang-format-infer.sh --cxx-compiler=... --clang-format=... --constants=... --source-dir=...

The program never halts, but it periodically prints to stdout the filename of a
clang-format config containing the best options found so far. That file is meant to be set
as your .clang-format file.
