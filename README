clang-format-infer tries to find a clang-format file that matches the style of your
existing codebase as closely as possible.

The indended users are projects that want to use an automatic formatter without making big
changes in their current style and without taking a deep-dive into all of clang-format's
obscure options.

It is known to work with clang-format 3.8.

Usage:

First, put the source files you want to optimize for in a directory.

Second, alter the "constants" file to fit your required options.

Finally:

./clang-format-infer.sh --cxx-compiler=... --clang-format=... --constants=... --source-dir=...

The stdout is a clang-format file; stderr includes diagnostics.
