clang-format-infer tries to find a clang-format file that matches the style of your
existing codebase as closely as possible.

It is known to work with clang-format 3.8.

Usage:

First, put the source files you want to optimize for in a directory.

Second, alter the "constants" file to fit your required options.

Finally:

./clang-format-infer.sh --cxx-compiler=... --clang-format=... --constants=... --source-dir=...

The stdout is a clang-format file; stderr includes diagnostics.
